## General Info

Showing a new home buyer a render and blueprint is a good place to start, but nothing beats the experience of holding a physical representation of the floor plan in the hand.

These 3D Printed floor plans and the CNC carved terrain they fit in provide a tactile way to show a buyer what they are purchasing and how it will look after it's built.

The final floor plans were SLA 3D printed in white nylon plastic. The base was CNC carved from walnut wood and trimmed with cherry. The carved walnut tray was designed to roughly match the actual grade and layout of the actual lots the floor plans will live on after purchase.
